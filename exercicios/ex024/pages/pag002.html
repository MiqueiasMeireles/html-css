        A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down 
        to prevent damage to your computer.

        If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen,
        restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow
        these steps:

        Check to be sure you have adequate disk space. If a driver is
        identified in the Stop message, disable the driver or check
        with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video
        adapters.

        Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable
        BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need
        to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your
        computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then
        select Safe Mode.
